HOT Activation Working Group
# Terms of Reference
## July 2023 Draft
# Background and Scope
*The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) Activation Working Group (AWG) is tasked by the Board of Directors with developing, coordinating and/or proposing procedures, monitoring, tools, and/or other recommendations for management of HOT's disaster mapping program in collaboration with HOT Staff, voting members and volunteer community.*  

In alignment with ~[HOT’s Living Strategy](https://www.hotosm.org/living-strategy)~, the AWG's **priorities** are:
1 Enable HOT to live its values of “Put People First”, “Collaborate for Impact”, “Build for Inclusivity” and “Working in the Open” by…
	1 Providing a space for HOT staff (global and regional hubs), volunteers and community to collaborate on disaster mapping strategies and activities
	2 Providing a space to connect, and promote collaboration, with humanitarian stakeholders to address their needs in using OpenStreetMap for disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM)
2 Advance HOT’s role as a catalyst in the open mapping movement by…
	1 Supporting the capacity building of local communities to lead their own disaster mapping needs
	2 Increasing the number of trained Activation Coordinators (Activators) globally and locally to further increase the self-sufficiency of the OSM community
	3 Intentionally encourage the participation of more local and more diverse OSM community members in disaster-affected countries in disaster mapping activities

⠀Objectives
* Foster collaborative and inclusive spaces for mappers, map users and map supporters for crisis mapping
* Provide for effective and efficient development of procedures and processes for managing disaster mapping by providing input and feedback on initiatives (e.g. of local communities, HOT and its Regional Hubs, and partner organizations) to ensure outputs are delivered in a way that local communities and general public can utilize 
* Assist in evaluating and processing requests for mapping support in preparation for, during, and post-crisis events
* Serve as a forum for coordination during the entire Activation cycle, and 

⠀(as needed) liaise with local communities and external partners during Activations 
* Surge / specialist support for HOT (largely hubs) and other relevant activation leaders?

⠀Activities
* Meet on a regular basis to ensure alignment and that community mapping needs are addressed
* Lead on designing DRRM mapping strategies (e.g. ~[Activation Protocol](https://hotosm.org/activation_protocol)~)
* Steward the Activation ~[Training Curriculum](https://hotosm.gitbook.io/curriculumworkspace/)~ and ~[Training Center](http://courses.hotosm.org/)~
  * Assist with onboarding new Activators
  * Role Endorsement
  * Review and Enhance training content
  * Keep training relevant to changes in protocol and current practices
* Support ~[Activations](https://www.hotosm.org/disaster-services/project_activations.html)~
  * Lead or participate in Activations declared by HOT
  * Support locally led Disaster Mapping
  * Promote Activator training and engagement between responses
  * Assess mapping capacity i.e. validators, activators and mappers

⠀Membership
# Members
The list of current AWG members can be found here: ~[https://groups.google.com/a/hotosm.org/forum/?hl=en\#!members/activation](https://groups.google.com/a/hotosm.org/forum/?hl=en#!members/activation)~ 
*page only visible to logged in members of the group

Each member should use one email address for AWG mailing list registration.
Owners (WG Leads) have full control, while managers only have moderation rights.
# Roles
* WG lead: chairs meetings, sends meeting reminders, manages group tools
  * Often fulfilled by, but not restricted to HOT staff
* WG co-lead(s): helps organize meeting tasks (bot, minutes, etc) and group tools
  * Also often staff member(s) perform this role, but not required 
* Activation Working Group Members: participate, can vote on items and bring new business
  * See below for how to join/become an AWG member
* Public: can participate and bring business, but not vote
  * Voting is rare, typically only required for contested decisions or major policy revision
  * Voting is not the same as polling (*i.e. A poll to gauge the groups interest in changing meeting time can be done to gain consensus, including non-member participants in the meeting/poll.)

⠀How to Join
Anyone can participate in the AWG, you don't have to be a HOT member or endorsed Activator. The best way is attending meetings (see below).

To join the AWG mailing list and participate in Activation Coordination, you must complete the Activation Essentials course here: ~[http://courses.hotosm.org/](http://courses.hotosm.org/)~ and complete the optional assignment, which will provide instructions to send a short introduction and request to join.

Anyone completing the course and assignment will automatically be added to the AWG after approval by any working group lead. Any proposed rejection should be discussed, motivated and approved at the next meeting of the AWG. 
# Off-boarding
Between April 2022 and May 2023 the Activation Working Group developed a procedure for ‘off-boarding’ Activators due to inactivity. The entire document can be read at: ~[Activator Off-boarding Process 2023May](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qF-CmlFsBwGrpGpnlTq7ktDZ2fwVie7KIHZ1wI8gLXo/edit?usp=sharing)~

Brief: all Activators are expected to stay engaged as to stay on-top of latest best practices. To do so, it is required that they participate in at least one activation, AWG meeting or training at the HOT Training Center at least once every year.
# Meetings
# Format
The AWG meetings are held publicly. The duration of the meeting is normally an hour but this can go over if there are pressing matters still to discuss.
# Frequency
Meetings are held at least monthly. Frequency may increase as needed, especially in the event of a large-scale Activation.
# Chairperson
The chair(s) of the working group are typically those who volunteer to facilitate meetings. If no volunteers come forth then the disaster or online community staff shall chair the meetings until a volunteer expresses interest in becoming (a) chair. If for any reason no chair is available to  conduct the meeting, the meeting should be rescheduled for another time. 
# Communication Channels
* Internal communication during minor or no activation
  * Public meetings for general housekeeping, development and coordination; and asynchronous chat on the HOT Slack #disaster-mapping channel
  * Updates/requests and general discussion via AWG mailing list
* Internal communication during activation
  * Most communication happens on the #disaster-mapping Slack channel
  * Coordination via AWG mailing list and/or private Slack channels
  * As needed, public discussion via discourse, mailing lists and other platforms
* External communication during activation
  * Receive and evaluate external requests via mailing list
  * Collaborate with Community and Partnerships staff for external comms
  * Defer and work with Communication WG for announcements
