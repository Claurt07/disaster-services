# TEMPLATE - Emergencies mapping response LAC
1. Event Size Up
Report the incident size up using the form
2. Determinate the Area of Interest (AOI)
3. Estimate Data and Imagery Needs**
**a.** **Bing**
**b.** **ESRI**
**c.** **OpenAerialMap**
4. Determinate if activation is necessary and what type of activation
Determine type of response. E.g. remote and/or field mapping, training, etc. This is based on feedback from
the affected communities (if possible) or from external sources as listed in Phase 0.
5. Declaration of Activation
Create a copy of the Checklist and add it to the project folder
MAKE A COPY OF THIS TEMPLATE and save it in the project folder within the REG_Emergencies
Activations folder
Formalize Activation Team – HUB Staff, LAC Validators, Humanitarian Brigade, OSM Caribbean, local and
regional specific OSM communities
Establish Internal Communication and Coordination Tools
Create Initial Project(s)
Projects are to be created in either the** ***Caribbean Mapper Community*** **or** ***Open Mapping Hub for Latin America and the Caribbean**  **organization on TM based on the nature of the activation.
Instructions for projects in TM (multiple languages)
Note: A maximum of 3 projects per platform should be created/active at any one time per
activation
If more projects are required, to save time, additional projects can be created and saved as
‘draft’ until the first set of published projects are completed.
Monitoring and updating of activation checklist
6. Collect and/or Provide 3W Information - Who does What, Where?
Monitor via different coordination and communication tools including Slack, Asana
Compile and document information using best tool for the Hub that can also be shared with central teams
and other stakeholders, e.g. AWG
Update CR
M
7. Announce the Activation
#disaster-mapping Slack Channel
Hub Channel
Create Wiki Page
Update Wiki page daily
1. Maintain communications
Internal: Slack ‘lac-emergency-activations-management’ channel**
### Phase 1 - Determinate Response
### Phase 2. Response Activities

Information sharing:
via Wiki pages, Hub Social Media (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter), HOT Website,
and possible collaboration with OSM Chapters Social Media e.g. OSM Caribbean, Asana - coordination and
workflow
2. Ongoing review
Imagery
Post-event imagery may become available as well as additional sources of pre-event imagery. This must
be reviewed and integrated into projects (via OpenAerialMap or other tools) so volunteers can use the
most appropriate imagery for the tasks they are asked to perform.
OSM Data
Both existing and newly generated OSM mapping data will need to be continually reviewed to make sure
overall data quality remains high and any identified issues or deficiencies are corrected as soon as
possible, with the associated adjustments to the instructions and/or training documents.
External Data
Third party data, both existing and newly generated will be available, often identified and shared through
the coordination channels. The usef
ulness of this data to the mission objectives needs to be evaluated, as
well as whether it can be incorporated into OSM legally and how
best to do so.
3. Manage Mapping Activities
Determine Appropriate Data Model
Conduct a review of available data models. This may be dynamic as priorities change. It also may require
developing or modifying existing data models to fit local geography, construction, and cultural
differences; such as Highway Tag Africa12 or local tagging guidelines (where available).
Onboard New
Mappers
Often new mappers reach out through the mailing list and IRC and many more join but never ask for help.
Try to identify new mappers who need gentle guidance on mapping best practices, and make use of
external resources to help with guidance.
Manage Mapping Projects
As feedback and information is received, focusing mapping with priority areas will ensure that we are
responding with the most critical data first. The better projects are managed, the more efficient and
effective mapping efforts will be.
Review
Mapping Progress
An overall status of the mapping progress needs to be maintained. This can be achieved with a table on
the wikipage. As news fades from the headlines, it may be necessary to make clear and direct asks of the
community or for assistance mapping within specific Tasking Manager projects.
Document and Recognize Achievement
In order to keep mappers, validators and Activators motivated; frequent updates on achievements made is
very
valuable. Recognizing individuals or groups of contributors that have made a significant impact
keeps not only them going but influences others who want to be recognized.
Coordinate with Responders
Coordinating with other organizations to determine what geodata is required will guide mapping focus
and objectives. Means of communication can vary. Activators will be diligent to include all stakeholders in
appropriate channels.
4. Manage exports and data products
5. Manage technical issues
6. Monitor event scope**

7. Ongoing Documentation and Reporting
Short-term activation: 1 final report
Long-term activation (>1 month): monthly reporting + final report
1. Review
Map Data and Usability
2. Plan long-term support and capacity building
3. Conclude the activation
4. Review methodology and results
Debrief with team, OSM communities and other stakeholders
5. Final reporting
Debrief and AAR Template
Use the template as guideliness.
Don't forget to save it in the proper shared folder.
After Action Review (AAR) Form
Use the form to make the report
