# HOTOSM Disaster Services Documentation

This is the public portal for HOT's Disaster Services, guidance, tools, and resources in open humanitarian mapping.

The resources here are used internally by HOT Open Mapping Hubs, the HOT Central team, and associated communities. In keeping with HOT's commitment to open data, public resources, collaboration, and above all community-first action, we are pleased to make this repository available to anyone&mdash;not only to read, but to contribute with content, suggestions, critiques, and resources.

## What are HOT's diaster Services 

HOT's mission regarding disasters is to provide open geographic data and technical support for humanitarian response, disaster preparedness, and recovery.

HOT was officially founded in 2010 in response to the Haiti earthquake. However, its roots can be traced back to earlier informal efforts within the OpenStreetMap community to respond to disasters ([as seen in the listed responses in the wiki for 2009](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Humanitarian_OSM_Team)). Since its inception, HOT has been involved in mapping efforts for various crises around the world, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and disease outbreaks
